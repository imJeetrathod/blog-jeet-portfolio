I got tired of manually copy-pasting file contents every time I wanted to ask an AI about my code. It's a repetitive task that gets old quickly.

You have a problem, you want the AI's help, but first you have to explain your folder structure, copy over the relevant files, and describe how it all fits together. I decided to automate it.

So, I built a small web tool called **folder2context**.

## The Core Problem

When using AI for coding, I kept repeating the same steps: manually copying file contents, explaining the project structure, and hoping the AI understood the context.

This was especially annoying for real-world projects with nested directories and files the AI doesn't need to see, like `node_modules`.

For instance, a simple project might look like this:

```
your-project/
├── src/
│ ├── index.js
│ ├── utils.js
│ └── api.js
├── public/
│ └── index.html
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── node_modules/
└── README.md
```

I didn't want to manually clean that up or waste tokens on irrelevant files.

## What My Tool Does

folder2context takes a project folder and turns it into a clean, readable format that I can paste directly into a prompt.

It generates a folder tree, includes the content of relevant files, and automatically ignores common clutter like `.git` or `node_modules`.

The result is a single formatted output. I just select my project folder, click a button, and the context is ready to be pasted into ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever other tool I'm using.

Here’s a simplified example of its output:

```
Folder: your-project

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
├── src
│ ├── index.js
│ ├── utils.js
│ └── api.js
├── public
│ └── index.html
├── package.json
└── README.md

FILE CONTENTS:
--- FILE: src/index.js ---
import { fetchData } from './api';
import { formatResult } from './utils';

--- FILE: src/api.js ---
export async function fetchData() {
// ...
}
```

The idea is simple: give the AI the full picture without the noise.

## A Quick Look at the Build

I built folder2context as a plain web application. The interface is minimal—just a folder selector and a button.

The core logic handles directory traversal, filtering out junk files, and formatting the output. I kept configuration to a minimum because the goal was to solve a personal problem, not build a feature-heavy developer tool.

## What Worked Well

The biggest win is time. I probably save 5–10 minutes every time I ask an AI for help on a real project, which adds up.

It’s been most useful for debugging issues, getting refactoring suggestions, and giving an AI enough context for a quick code review. The formatted output seems to help the AI understand how files relate to each other.

## Where It's Not a Perfect Solution

This tool doesn't magically solve token limits. For large projects, I still have to be selective about which parts of the codebase to include.

It also skips binary files and images entirely. Usually that's what I want, but sometimes I still have to manually explain what those assets are.

The tool shows structure and content, not architecture. For complex systems, I still add a short explanation myself.

## Was It Worth It?

Definitely. It's a small utility that solves a specific, recurring problem. The time investment was a few hours, and I've already saved more time than that.

It seems a few other developers I've shared it with have the same pain point. It's nothing groundbreaking, just a practical fix.

## How I Use It Now

I use folder2context almost daily. It's become a standard part of my workflow: identify an issue, generate context, and paste it into an AI.

I even used it while building this site. When I needed AI help with Next.js components or MDX handling, I just fed the project context to the AI.
